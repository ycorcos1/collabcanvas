# Canvas Tools - Testing Guide

## ✅ **Phase 1 Complete: All Tools Fixed**

### **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Shape Tool Mapping**: Fixed the mapping between toolbar shape names and Canvas component types:

   - `rectangle` → `rect`
   - `circle` → `ellipse`
   - Added support for all shape types (polygon, triangle, line, arrow, star)

2. **Tool Selection Flow**: Ensured all tool buttons properly communicate with the Canvas component through:

   - `onToolSelect(shapeType)` for shape tools
   - `onCursorModeChange(mode)` for cursor, text, and brush tools

3. **State Management**: All tool selections now persist correctly in localStorage and session storage

## 🐛 **Known Issues to Watch For**

### **Potential Issues**:

1. **Shape positioning at high zoom**: Verify shapes appear where clicked, not offset
2. **Text editing**: Make sure text box doesn't disappear when typing
3. **Brush smoothness**: Check for jagged lines on slow drag
4. **Tool persistence**: Verify selected tool persists after page refresh
5. **Multiple users**: Test with 2+ users simultaneously (if collaboration is enabled)

### **Console Errors**:

- Check browser console (F12) for any errors
- Look for red error messages
- Check for warnings about deprecated code
- Monitor performance (should stay above 30 FPS)

---

## 📊 **Performance Metrics**

### **Target Performance**:

- **Frame Rate**: 60 FPS during drawing/interaction
- **Shape Creation**: < 50ms from click to shape appearance
- **Tool Switch**: < 100ms delay

- **Zoom**: Smooth transition, no jank

### **How to Check**:

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Performance tab
3. Click Record
