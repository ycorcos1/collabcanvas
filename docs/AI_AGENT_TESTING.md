---

## ✅ Context Awareness

### Contextual References

- ✅ "this" refers to selected shape
- ✅ "the" refers to selected shape when one selected
- ✅ "it" refers to selected shape
- ✅ Error when no selection and using contextual words

### Shape Identification

- ✅ "the red circle" finds by color and type
- ✅ "the rectangle" finds when only one exists
- ✅ Multiple shapes of same type triggers ambiguity

---

## ✅ Error Handling

### Ambiguity Detection

- ✅ Multiple circles: `"Which circle? There are 3..."`
- ✅ Multiple rectangles: `"Which rectangle? There are 5..."`
- ✅ Vague "the shape": `"Which shape? There are 10..."`

### Command Suggestions

- ✅ "draw a" → suggests "create a shape"
- ✅ "make bigger" → suggests "twice as big"
- ✅ "remove" → suggests "delete"

### Collaborative Locks

- ✅ Cannot delete locked shape
- ✅ Cannot update locked shape
- ✅ Error message includes locking user's name
- ✅ Multiple locked shapes listed

### Rate Limiting

- ✅ 50 commands/hour limit enforced
- ✅ Error message clear
- ✅ Limit resets after 1 hour
- ✅ Per-project scope works

### Network Errors

- ✅ Retry logic works (3 attempts)
- ✅ Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- ✅ Non-retryable errors skip retry
- ✅ Clear error messages

---

## ✅ Intent Router (Client-Side)

### Creation Commands

- ✅ "create a rectangle" → instant
- ✅ "add a circle" → instant
- ✅ "make a square" → instant
- ✅ "create text" → instant

### Modification Commands

- ✅ "make it blue" → instant
- ✅ "resize twice as big" → instant
- ✅ "rotate 45 degrees" → instant

### Selection Commands

### Complex Commands

- ✅ Ambiguous commands → fallback to OpenAI
- ✅ Multi-step commands → fallback to OpenAI

---

## ✅ Performance

### Latency Measurements

- ✅ Intent router: 10-50ms (instant feel)

---

## ✅ Edge Cases

### Empty Canvas
