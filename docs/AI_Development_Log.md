**AI Development Log \- HØRIZON Collaborative Canvas**  
Yahav Corcos

**Project Overview:**  
HØRIZON is a real-time collaborative design canvas application with integrated AI assistance, built using React, Firebase, Konva.js, and OpenAI's GPT-4. The project demonstrates extensive use of AI coding agents throughout the development lifecycle, from initial architecture to bug fixes and feature enhancements.

**1\. Tools & Workflow Integration**  
**_Primary AI Tools Used:_**  
Cursor AI with Claude Sonnet 4.5 served as the primary development assistant throughout the project lifecycle. The workflow integrated AI at multiple levels:

- Architecture Design: AI helped structure the codebase into a clean separation of concerns (components, hooks, services, types, utils), ensuring scalability from day one.
- Code Generation: Large portions of the Firebase integration, Konva canvas rendering, and real-time collaboration features were scaffolded with AI assistance, then refined through iterative prompting.
- Debugging & Troubleshooting: AI proved invaluable for diagnosing complex issues like Firestore index errors, shape persistence bugs, and real-time sync race conditions.
- Refactoring: Major refactors (e.g., migrating from a universal canvas to project-based shapes, implementing page-based architecture) were executed through structured AI-guided action plans.
- Documentation: AI generated comprehensive inline documentation, type definitions, and this development log itself.

**_Workflow Pattern_**  
The development cycle typically followed this pattern:

- Requirement Definition → Product requirements translated into structured task lists
- Ask Mode Analysis → AI analyzes the problem, identifies root causes, proposes solutions
- Action Plan Creation → Structured, step-by-step implementation plans
- Agent Mode Execution → AI executes the plan with file edits and terminal commands
- Verification & Iteration → Manual testing, then back to Ask Mode for refinements

**2\. Effective Prompting Strategies**  
**_Strategy 1:_** PRD-to-Task-to-Implementation Pipeline  
**_Prompt Pattern:_**  
"Review @collabcanvas_prd.md and create a comprehensive task list  
covering all features, breaking down complex features into atomic tasks.  
Prioritize by dependencies and technical risk."

**_Why It Worked:_** This hierarchical approach prevented scope creep and ensured all PRD requirements were tracked. The task list became a contract between human intent and AI execution, making it easy to resume work across sessions.

**_Example Application:_** The entire AI Agent feature (commands, tools, intent routing) was built this way—PRD defined capabilities, task list broke down into 50+ discrete items, then Agent Mode executed each systematically.

**_Strategy 2: Bug Diagnosis → Action Plan → Fix Cycle_**  
**_Prompt Pattern:_**  
"\[In Ask Mode\] The layers panel visibility toggle doesn't persist on  
refresh. The object still doesn't remain hidden and hiding/showing it  
causes other objects to shift around. Identify the root cause and create  
a concise action plan to execute in agent mode."

**_Why It Worked:_** Separating diagnosis from execution prevented hasty fixes. AI could analyze the full context (Firestore schema, component lifecycle, Konva rendering) before proposing changes, reducing rework.

**_Example Application:_** Fixed complex issues like text tool bugs, keyboard shortcut conflicts, and presence panel real-time updates—each requiring multi-file changes coordinated through action plans.

**_Strategy 3: Test-Driven Feature Validation_**  
**_Prompt Pattern:_**  
"@05_AI_AGENT_TESTS.md review all tests marked 'Fail'. Ensure the AI Agent  
can execute these commands. Create a concise action plan addressing:  
grid creation, text styling, canvas clearing, element spacing, and  
error handling polish."

**_Why It Worked:_** Using test files as the source of truth forced AI to consider edge cases and ensure feature completeness, not just "making it work." This led to more robust implementations.

**_Example Application:_** AI Agent command execution was refined through multiple test-driven iterations, catching issues like "delete all triangles" clearing the entire canvas instead of filtering by type.

**_Strategy 4: Architecture Review with Specific Criteria_**  
**_Prompt Pattern:_**  
"Evaluate the codebase against these specific criteria: \[paste rubric\].  
For each point, cite specific files/patterns and explain how the  
implementation satisfies or falls short of the requirement."

**_Why It Worked:_** Structured evaluation prompts produced detailed, evidence-based assessments rather than generic praise. This helped identify genuine gaps (e.g., need for export functionality improvements).

**_Example Application:_** Used to verify the codebase met "Excellent" standards for architecture quality, authentication security, and error handling before project completion.

**_Strategy 5: Context-Aware Progressive Enhancement_**  
**_Prompt Pattern:_**  
"The text tool works but text manipulation doesn't. Polish this up using  
common and best practices. Consider: Konva text node wrapping, transform  
anchors, font style rendering, and dimension persistence."

**_Why It Worked:_** Asking AI to "polish" with specific technical considerations (not just "fix it") led to implementations that matched industry standards (e.g., width-only resizing for text, proper height recomputation).

**_Example Application:_** Text tool enhancement, where AI added bold/italic/underline support, fixed resizing behavior, and implemented click-to-create with proper defaults—all in one coherent action plan.

**3\. Strengths & Limitations of AI-Assisted Development**  
**_Where AI Excelled_**  
**_1\. Architecting the AI Agent System_**  
Surprisingly, one of the most complex features—the AI Agent with natural language command processing—was the easiest to build with AI assistance. The agent required:

- Intent routing (40+ command patterns)
- Tool registry (20+ canvas operations)
- Color normalization (colorNameToHex)
- Ambiguity detection and error handling
- Multi-step action sequencing

**_Why AI excelled here:_** This was a greenfield implementation with clear requirements and no existing constraints. AI could scaffold the entire architecture—from the aiAgent.ts intent router to individual tools in aiTools.ts—in structured passes. Each component had well-defined inputs/outputs, making it ideal for AI code generation.

**_2\. Rapid Prototyping & Boilerplate Generation_**  
Firebase service layers, TypeScript type definitions, and hook scaffolding were generated quickly and correctly. AI understood the patterns (e.g., Firestore converters, React custom hooks) and replicated them consistently across files.

**3\. Documentation & Error Message Humanization**  
AI excelled at writing clear inline comments, JSDoc annotations, and user-friendly error messages. The authentication error handler that converts Firebase codes to readable messages was entirely AI-generated and production-ready.

**_Where AI Struggled_**  
**_1\. Minor UI Bug Fixes and Visual Polish_**  
Ironically, while AI built the complex AI Agent system with ease, it struggled with seemingly simple UI issues:

- **Text tool click-to-create:** Took multiple iterations to get the minimum drag distance threshold right and implement default sizing correctly.
- **Textbox resizing:** Required 5+ refinement cycles to achieve proper width-only resizing with accurate height recomputation—something a human developer familiar with Konva would fix in one pass.

**Why AI struggled here:** These bugs existed in legacy code with accumulated complexity—event handlers, lifecycle effects, prop drilling, and Konva's imperative API all interacting. AI had to:

- Understand the existing buggy behavior
- Trace through multiple files to find root cause
- Propose a fix that doesn't break other features
- Account for edge cases in user interactions

This "surgical precision" in existing codebases is harder for AI than building from scratch, where it can establish clean patterns from the start.

**_2\. Cross-File State Synchronization_**  
Real-time collaboration bugs (cursor streaming delays, presence panel not updating) required deep understanding of Firebase's eventual consistency model and React's reconciliation. AI often proposed solutions that fixed the symptom but not the root cause (e.g., adding setState instead of fixing the snapshot listener logic).

**_3\. Performance Optimization_**  
AI rarely proactively suggested performance improvements like memoization, debouncing, or lazy loading without explicit prompting. It optimized individual functions well but missed system-level bottlenecks.

**4\. Key Learnings**  
**_1\. Prompt Quality Determines Output Quality_**  
**_The Discovery:_** Generic prompts like "fix the text tool" produced generic, incomplete solutions. Specific prompts with technical context ("Implement click-to-create for the text tool; when drag distance \< 8px, create a 200x50 default textbox and immediately enter edit mode") led to correct implementations on the first try.

**_The Principle:_** AI coding agents are compilers for natural language—garbage in, garbage out. The effort spent crafting a precise 3-sentence prompt saves hours of debugging vague AI-generated code.

**_Practical Application:_** Before asking AI to implement anything, I learned to:

- Specify the desired behavior clearly
- Mention relevant technical constraints (e.g., Konva API methods, Firebase schema)
- Reference related files that should be considered
- Describe edge cases that must be handled

**2\. Execution Plans Are Non-Negotiable for Complex Changes**  
**_The Discovery:_** Early in the project, I'd ask AI to "add multi-page support" and let it run in agent mode immediately. This led to:

- Incomplete implementations (forgot to update types)
- Breaking changes (shapes rendered for wrong pages)
- Rollback and rework cycles

**_The Solution:_** Mandatory Ask Mode → Action Plan → Agent Mode workflow for any change touching 3+ files. Action plans forced AI to:

- List all files requiring changes
- Explain the sequence of edits (dependencies)
- Identify potential breaking points
- Provide a verification checklist

**_Measured Impact:_** After adopting this workflow, the "first-pass success rate" for multi-file features increased from \~40% to \~85%, dramatically reducing development time.

**3\. AI Needs Constraints, Not Freedom**  
**_The Paradox:_** More prescriptive prompts led to better solutions than open-ended ones. When I said "improve error handling," AI added try-catch blocks everywhere (bloat). When I said "wrap all Firebase operations in try-catch with user-friendly toast notifications and fallback to no-op in critical paths," AI produced elegant error boundaries.

**_The Insight:_** AI explores a vast solution space—your job is to constrain that space to good architectures. Provide the "rails," let AI handle the "routing."

**4\. Test Files as Executable Specifications**  
**_The Breakthrough:_** Creating 03_CANVAS_TESTS.md and 05_AI_AGENT_TESTS.md with Pass/Fail checklists turned QA into an AI-drivable process. Instead of manually verifying 50 features after each change, I could:

- Run through tests manually (5 minutes)
- Prompt AI: "Address all Fail marks in @05_AI_AGENT_TESTS.md"
- Review action plan, approve execution
- Re-test only the changed features

**_The Lesson:_** Invest time upfront in structured test documentation. It becomes a shared language between developer and AI, and a regression safety net.  
**Conclusion**  
Building HØRIZON with AI assistance demonstrated that AI coding agents are most effective when treated as highly skilled junior developers—exceptional at executing clear instructions, but requiring senior oversight for architecture decisions and quality assurance. The key to success was establishing structured workflows (PRD → Tasks → Action Plans → Execution) and investing in high-quality prompts that provide both context and constraints.  
The project would have taken an estimated 3-4 weeks of solo development; with AI assistance and proper prompting strategies, core functionality was achieved in approximately 5 days of active development. The productivity multiplier was real, but only because the human developer understood when to drive (architecture, requirements) and when to delegate (implementation, documentation).

**Final Insight:** AI didn't replace software engineering—it made engineering more strategic. Less time typing boilerplate, more time designing systems.
