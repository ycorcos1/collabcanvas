---

## üí° Smart Features

### Context Awareness

The AI understands contextual references:

**"this", "the", "it"** refer to SELECTED shapes:

```
User: (selects a circle)
User: "make it blue"
AI: ‚úÖ Changes the selected circle to blue

User: "duplicate this"
AI: ‚úÖ Duplicates the selected circle
```

### Color Intelligence

Use color names or hex codes:

```
"make it red"        ‚Üí #FF0000
"change to blue"     ‚Üí #0000FF
"make it #FF5733"    ‚Üí #FF5733
"change to orange"   ‚Üí #FFA500
```

Supported colors: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple, pink, black, white, gray, grey, brown, cyan, magenta

### Automatic Ambiguity Detection

If your command is ambiguous, the AI will ask for clarification:

```
User: "delete the circle"
Canvas: Has 3 circles
AI: "Which circle? There are 3 circles on the canvas.
     Please select one first or be more specific (e.g., 'the red circle')."
```

### Helpful Suggestions

The AI provides suggestions for unclear commands:

```
User: "draw a something"
AI: "Did you mean 'create a shape'?
     Try: 'create a rectangle', 'create a circle', or 'create text that says...'"

User: "make bigger"
AI: "Please specify how much bigger or smaller.
     Try: 'make it twice as big' or 'resize to 200x200'"
```

---

## üîí Collaboration Features

### Locked Shapes

When another user is editing a shape, the AI respects their lock:

```
User A: (selects and edits a red circle)
User B: "delete the red circle"
AI: ‚ùå "Cannot delete circle - locked by User A"
```

### Multi-User Awareness

The AI is aware of all users in the project:

```
User: "delete all selected shapes"
Canvas: 5 shapes selected, 2 locked by other users
AI: ‚ùå "Cannot delete 2 shapes - locked by Alice, Bob"
```

---

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

### Fast Commands (Instant Response)

These commands use the local intent router and execute instantly:

- Simple shape creation ("create a rectangle")
- Basic modifications ("make it blue", "rotate 45")
- Selection operations ("select all circles")
- Duplication ("duplicate this")
- Deletion ("delete the selected shape")

### Complex Commands (2-3 seconds)

These commands use OpenAI and take a bit longer:

- Ambiguous references without selection
- Complex multi-step operations
- Natural language variations

**Tip**: Select shapes first for faster results!

---

## üö´ Rate Limits

To ensure fair usage, the AI is limited to:

- **50 commands per hour** per user

If you hit the limit:

```
AI: "Rate limit exceeded. Please wait before sending more commands. (50 commands per hour)"
```

The limit resets after 1 hour from your first command.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No shapes selected"

**Problem**: You used "this", "it", or "the shape" but nothing is selected.

**Solution**: Select a shape first using the move tool, or be more specific:

```
Instead of: "make it blue"
Try: "make the red circle blue"
```

### "Which circle?"

**Problem**: Multiple shapes of the same type exist.

**Solution**: Select the shape first, or be more specific:

```
Instead of: "delete the circle"
Try: "delete the red circle" or select it first, then "delete this"
```

### "Cannot delete - locked by [User]"

**Problem**: Another user is currently editing that shape.

**Solution**: Wait for them to finish, or work on a different shape.

### "Rate limit exceeded"

**Problem**: You've used 50+ commands in the last hour.

**Solution**: Wait a few minutes and try again. The limit resets rolling hourly.

### Command Not Working?

Try these steps:

1. **Be more specific**: "create a rectangle" instead of "make something"
2. **Select first**: Select shapes before using "this" or "it"
3. **Check the canvas**: Make sure shapes exist before trying to modify them
4. **Simplify**: Break complex requests into multiple simple commands

## üìö Advanced Usage

### Chaining Operations

You can describe multiple operations, and the AI will execute them:

```
"create a red circle, duplicate it, and move it 100px right"
```

However, for best results, issue separate commands:

```
1. "create a red circle"
2. "duplicate it"
3. "move it to 200, 200"
```

### Relative Positioning

Create shapes relative to selected shapes:

```
User: (selects a rectangle)
User: "create a circle below this"
AI: ‚úÖ Creates circle below the rectangle with proper spacing
```

### Scaling Factors

Use natural language for scaling:

```
"make it twice as big"     ‚Üí 2x scale
"make it 3 times bigger"   ‚Üí 3x scale
"double the size"          ‚Üí 2x scale
"scale it 4x"              ‚Üí 4x scale
```

## üé® Best Practices

### 1. Select Before Modifying

```
‚úÖ Good: Select circle ‚Üí "make it blue"
‚ùå Slow: "make the red circle blue" (AI has to find it)
```

### 2. Use Specific Colors

```
‚úÖ Good: "create a red rectangle"
‚ö†Ô∏è Okay: "create a rectangle" (defaults to red)
```

### 3. Specify Positions

```
‚úÖ Good: "create a circle at 300, 400"
‚ö†Ô∏è Okay: "create a circle" (defaults to 400, 600)
```

### 4. Break Down Complex Tasks

```
‚úÖ Good:
   1. "create a card template"
   2. "duplicate it"
   3. "move it to 500, 300"

‚ùå Slower: "create a card template, duplicate it, and move the copy to 500, 300"
```

### 5. Use Templates for UI Elements

```
‚úÖ Good: "create a card template"
‚ùå Slower: "create a white rectangle with rounded corners..."
```

---

## üéØ Example Workflows

### Creating a Simple UI Layout

```
1. "create a card template at 200, 200"
2. "create a button at 250, 400"
3. "create text that says 'Welcome to H√òRIZON' at 220, 150"
4. "make the text blue"
```

### Duplicating and Arranging Shapes

```
1. "create a red circle"
2. "duplicate it"
3. (select both circles)
4. "distribute horizontally"
5. "duplicate them"
6. (select all 4)
7. "align to center"
```

### Building a Grid

```
1. "create a square at 200, 200"
2. "duplicate it"
3. "duplicate it"
4. (select all 3)
5. "distribute horizontally"
6. (select all 3 again)
7. "duplicate them"
8. (select all 6)
9. "align to top"
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Does the AI remember my previous commands?

**A**: The AI remembers commands within the same project session (until page refresh), but doesn't save chat history to the database to save quota.

### Q: Can the AI undo mistakes?

**A**: Not yet! Use the manual Undo function (Ctrl/Cmd+Z) to undo AI-created changes.

### Q: What happens if I make a typo?

**A**: The AI is quite good at understanding typos and will often figure out what you meant. If it's unclear, it will ask for clarification or provide suggestions.

### Q: Can I use the AI while others are editing?

**A**: Yes! The AI respects collaborative locks and will let you know if a shape is being edited by someone else.

### Q: How do I report an AI bug?

**A**: Please contact support with:

- The exact command you used
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- A screenshot if possible

### Q: Will more templates be added?

**A**: Yes! We're constantly adding new templates. Check the templates folder for updates.
