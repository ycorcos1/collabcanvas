## Environment Setup

1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password method)
3. Create a Firestore database
4. Create a Realtime Database
5. Copy your Firebase config and create `.env` file:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your_project_id-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com

# AI Agent (optional)
VITE_ENABLE_AI_AGENT=true
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
VITE_USE_AI_PROXY=false
```

6. Deploy Firebase rules:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only database:rules
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

### Vercel (recommended)

- This project uses a serverless AI proxy compatible with Vite on Vercel.
- The Edge Function is implemented with the standard Web Request/Response API (no Next.js runtime imports).
- SPA routing and API passthrough are configured in `vercel.json`.

Steps:

1. Set environment variables in Vercel Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables

```env
VITE_ENABLE_AI_AGENT=true
VITE_USE_AI_PROXY=true
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...            # Server-side only
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...       # Optional for local dev; not required when proxying

# Firebase
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=...
```

2. Push to GitHub and connect the repo to Vercel. Vercel will run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Routing:

- `api/ai/proxy` â†’ Edge Function (see `api/ai/proxy.ts`)
- All other routes â†’ `index.html` for SPA

### Firebase Hosting (optional)

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Canvas**: Konva.js with React-Konva wrapper
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth + Firestore + Realtime DB)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with function calling
- **Styling**: CSS modules with sunrise theme
- **State**: React hooks with custom canvas/auth/shapes/cursors/presence hooks
- **Real-time**: Firebase listeners with optimistic updates
- **Performance**: React.memo, throttling, Konva optimizations, client-side intent routing

## Key Features

### Authentication System

- Email/password authentication
- Persistent user sessions
- User profile management with colors

### Canvas System

- Smooth pan and zoom with mouse/trackpad
- 3000x3000 virtual workspace
- Visual grid for orientation
- 60 FPS performance

### Shape Manipulation

- Click-to-create rectangles
- Drag-to-move with selection feedback
- Real-time sync across all users
- Optimistic updates for responsiveness

### Multiplayer Features

- Real-time cursor tracking with <50ms latency
- Online user presence with avatars
- Connection status monitoring
- Automatic cleanup on disconnect

### Data Management

- Firestore for shape persistence
- Realtime Database for cursors/presence
- Optimistic updates with conflict resolution
- Error boundaries and graceful failure handling

### AI Agent Features ðŸ¤–

- **Natural Language Commands**: Control the canvas using plain English
- **9 AI Tools**: Create, delete, update, select, duplicate, rotate, align, distribute, templates
- **Context Awareness**: Understands "this", "the", "it" references to selected shapes
- **Collaborative Lock Respect**: Won't modify shapes locked by other users
- **Client-Side Intent Router**: <50ms response time for common commands
- **Memory Bank**: Pre-built templates (card, button) and smart defaults
- **Error Handling**: Ambiguity detection, command suggestions, retry logic
- **Rate Limiting**: 50 commands/hour to prevent abuse

Recent robustness updates:

- Color normalization (`red` â†’ `#FF0000`) prevents invalid color warnings.
- Dimension parsing supports `200x300`, `width 200`, `height 300`.
- Position parsing supports `at 100, 200`, `position 100, 200`, `at position 100, 200`.
- Scale commands: understands "twice", "double", "3x", "3 times".
- Shape-agnostic center movement: "move ... to the center" works for any type.
- Single/All/Ask targeting: if exactly one match, act; if many and not "all", request selection.
- Bulk tools: `update_many_shapes`, `delete_many_shapes`, `duplicate_many_shapes`, `rotate_many_shapes`.
- Clear canvas triggers an auto-save to persist deletion across refreshes.

#### Example AI Commands:

```
"create a red circle at 200, 300"
"make it twice as big"
"duplicate this shape"
"align them to the left"
"create a card template"
"rotate 45 degrees"
"change color to blue"
```

See [AI Agent Guide](docs/AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md) for complete documentation.

## Firebase Database Schema

### Firestore Structure

```
canvases/{canvasId}/shapes/{shapeId}
- type: 'rectangle'
- x, y: position coordinates
- width, height: dimensions
- color: hex color string
- createdBy: user ID
- createdAt, updatedAt: timestamps
```

### Realtime Database Structure

```
cursors/{canvasId}/{userId}
- x, y: cursor coordinates
- userName, userColor: user info
- timestamp: last update time

presence/{canvasId}/{userId}
- isOnline: boolean status
- userName, userColor: user info
- lastSeen: timestamp
```

## Security Rules

Firestore and Realtime Database rules ensure:

- Only authenticated users can access data
- Users can only modify their own cursor/presence data
- All users can read/write shapes (collaborative editing)

## Development Notes

The application implements the complete collaborative infrastructure and AI agent system as specified in the PRD. The codebase follows TypeScript strict mode and uses modern React patterns with hooks. All real-time features and AI commands work seamlessly with proper error handling and performance optimization.

### Recent engineering changes (highlights)

- Intent router fixes to avoid misclassifying updates as creates (e.g., "make all red ellipses blue").
- Safe color handling end-to-end (`fill`â†’`color` mapping, hex normalization).
- Presence stability: prevents online count flapping when switching tabs by reference counting `usePresence` subscribers.
- Safer `ProtectedRoute` user checks (no null access).
- OpenAI SDK compatibility: robust parsing of `tool_calls` in various SDK shapes.
- Edge Function migration: removed `next/server`, uses Web API `Request`/`Response`.
- `vercel.json` updated to keep `/api/*` on the server and SPA-route the rest.

### Quick troubleshooting

- If "Cannot find module 'next/server'" occurs on Vercel, ensure `api/ai/proxy.ts` matches this repo and `vercel.json` includes API rewrites.
- If AI clear canvas reverts on refresh, confirm the auto-save listener in `CanvasPage` is active and that a project ID exists.
- If online user count differs between clients, verify both use the same presence key (slug) and that youâ€™re on the latest build.

**Ready for production deployment, multi-user testing, and AI-powered collaboration!** ðŸš€
