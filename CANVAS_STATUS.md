### Test 2: Zoom In/Out ✅

1. Click the "+" button 2-3 times
2. **Expected**: Percentage increases (125%, 156%, 195%)
3. **Expected**: Canvas visually scales up
4. Click the "-" button
5. **Expected**: Percentage decreases
6. **Expected**: Canvas visually scales down

### Test 3: Hand Tool Panning ✅

5. **Expected**: Scrolling is smooth and contained to canvas area

### Test 5: Reset Zoom

1. Zoom to any level (e.g., 200%)
2. Click the percentage number in toolbar
3. **Expected**: Zoom resets to 100%
4. **Expected**: Canvas returns to full size

## 🎨 **Next Phase: Tool Testing**

### Tools to Test

1. **Move Tool** (arrow icon)
   - Select shapes
   - Move shapes
   - Resize shapes
2. **Shape Tools** (square icon dropdown)

   - Rectangle
   - Circle
   - Other shapes
   - Image upload

3. **Text Tool** (T icon)

   - Create text boxes
   - Edit text
   - Formatting

4. **Brush Tool** (brush icon)
   - Draw paths
   - Change size/color
   - Eraser mode

## 🐛 **Known Issues**

- None currently - all core navigation features working

## 📋 **Recommended Next Steps**

### Phase 1: Tool Verification (1-2 hours)

- [ ] Test all shape creation tools
- [ ] Test text tool functionality
- [ ] Test brush/drawing tool
- [ ] Test shape manipulation (move, resize, rotate)
- [ ] Verify all tools work at different zoom levels

### Phase 2: Polish & UX (2-3 hours)

- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl +/- for zoom)
- [ ] Improve visual feedback for active tools
- [ ] Add tooltip hints for new users
- [ ] Optimize performance for large canvases
- [ ] Test with multiple shapes (50+)

### Phase 3: Multi-user Testing (1-2 hours)

- [ ] Test with 2+ users simultaneously
- [ ] Verify real-time cursor tracking
- [ ] Test shape locking/unlocking
- [ ] Verify collaboration indicators
- [ ] Test presence system

### Phase 4: Edge Cases (1-2 hours)

- [ ] Test on different screen sizes
- [ ] Test on different browsers
- [ ] Test with slow network
- [ ] Test with many shapes (100+)
- [ ] Test rapid zoom changes

## 🚀 **Firebase Collaboration (Future)**

The Firebase collaboration features (projects, pages, invites, realtime sync) are planned for a future phase:

- Estimated effort: 40-80 hours development
- Requires separate branch
- Feature flag implementation
- Comprehensive testing
- Migration strategy for existing data

This should be tackled after current canvas features are fully polished and stable.

## 📝 **Notes**

- Homepage design is preserved ✅
- Overall layout unchanged ✅
- Canvas at 100% zoom by default ✅
- All navigation features working ✅
- Build successful with no errors ✅

**Status**: Ready for comprehensive tool testing phase
